# Nexus-pro-tuning-cap-holder-for-buffertube
do you have a dart zone nexus pro? but no where to store the tuning caps?

This 3d printable file is made for you! it has space for 2 tuning caps and slides over your buffertube. You only need to thighten it with minimal hardware.
1 5mm x 20 mm bolt, with a head no wider than 8.5mm
1 5mm nut with 8mm wrench flats

The sling buffertube mount is based on the design by https://www.thingiverse.com/haphazardlynamed/designs. but it has been modifiedto fit my needs.
